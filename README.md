## Which way should your tilt your venetian blinds?

At this time of the year, when the weather is starting to get warm, which way you tilt your blinds can have a massive impact on how comfortable your room is to sit in. For example:

#### Why you should tilt your blinds upwards:

This directs sunlight and heat towards the ceiling. Useful during the summer when you want to keep your room cool.
People outside cannot see into your house.

#### Why you should tilt your blinds downwards:

This directs the sunlight and heat towards the floor. Useful during the winter when you want to keep the room warm.
The blinds look aesthetically better. But people can see in more easily.
